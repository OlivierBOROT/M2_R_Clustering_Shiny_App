#### Usage

First, go to the **Data Upload** tab to import your dataset (CSV / XLSX formats). Then inspect the columns, assign types and roles (active / illustrative / excluded), and save. You can then run the clustering modules from the **Clustering** tab. Finally, export snapshots or reproducible report fragments for evaluation.

#### Project context

This project continues the R course work for the M2 SISE program. It aims to develop an R package to perform variable clustering analyses along with associated visualizations. The goal is to provide an interactive Shiny application that makes the package easy to use for its users.

**Key objectives:**

1. Implement 3 variable-clustering algorithms.  
2. Among the 3: at least one based on reallocation techniques; at least one dedicated to handling modalities of qualitative variables.  
3. Put in place a strategy for identifying the number of clusters (at least approaches that help identification).  
4. Integrate tools (tables, charts) that allow interpretation of the results: nature of partitions, nature of groups, degree of membership to clusters.  
5. Decide which parts you implement yourself and which existing tools/packages you use (only referenced packages, e.g. hclust). Document your choices.
