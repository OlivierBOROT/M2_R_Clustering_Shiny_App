\title{Calculate Euclidean distance between points and centers}
\usage{
euclidean_distance(points, centers)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{Matrix or data frame of points (rows = observations, columns = features).}

\item{centers}{Matrix or data frame of cluster centers (rows = centers, columns = features).
Must have the same number of columns as \code{points}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of distances with dimensions \code{nrow(centers)} by \code{nrow(points)}.
Element \code{[i, j]} contains the Euclidean distance from center \code{i} to point \code{j}.
