\title{Generate Euclidean Distance Matrix Based on Correlation (ClustOfVar Approach)}
\usage{
get_correlation_distance_matrix(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or matrix with variables in columns, observations in rows.
Supports numeric, integer, and factor variables.}
}
\value{
A \code{dist} object containing pairwise distances between variables.
}
\description{
Computes the Euclidean distance matrix between variables using the correlation-based
distance metric. For quantitative variables: \code{d(i,j) = sqrt(2 * (1 - cor(i,j)))}.
For mixed data, uses appropriate association measures (R², η², Cramér's V²).
This distance is guaranteed to be Euclidean and is the foundation of the ClustOfVar algorithm.
