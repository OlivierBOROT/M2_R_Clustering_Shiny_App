\title{Plot Scree Plot of Explained Variance by Cluster}
\usage{
plot_scree_by_cluster(clusterer, main = "Scree Plot by Cluster")
}
\arguments{
\item{clusterer}{A fitted clustering object inheriting from
\code{\link{BaseClusterer}}.}

\item{main}{Character string for the plot title
(default: \code{"Scree Plot by Cluster"}).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its side effect
of creating a plot.
}
\description{
Creates scree plots showing the variance explained by each principal component
within each cluster.
}
\details{
This function creates a multi-panel plot with one scree plot per cluster.
Each panel shows:
\itemize{
\item Bar plot: Percentage of variance explained by each PC
\item Red line: Cumulative percentage of variance explained
}

Requires that the clusterer has a \code{get_cluster_pca()} method that returns
PCA results for each cluster.

Useful for assessing cluster dimensionality and identifying whether a cluster
is well-represented by its first principal component.
